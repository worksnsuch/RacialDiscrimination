<h2> WHAT IS RACE DISCRIMINATION/ETHNICITY DISCRIMINATION? </h2>

<p> Race discrimination involves treating someone (an applicant or employee) unfavorably because he/she is of a certain race or because of personal characteristics associated with race (such as hair texture, skin color, or certain facial features). Color discrimination involves treating someone unfavorably because of skin color complexion.
Race/color discrimination also can involve treating someone unfavorably because the person is married to (or associated with) a person of a certain race or color.
Discrimination can occur when the victim and the person who inflicted the discrimination are the same race or color.
The treatment could be a one-off action or as a result of a rule or policy based on race. It doesnâ€™t have to be intentional to be unlawful.
 </p>

<h2> COLOR DISCRIMINATION </h2>

<p>Even though race and color clearly overlap, they are not synonymous. Thus, color discrimination can occur between persons of different races or ethnicities, or between persons of the same race or ethnicity. Although Title VII does not define "color," the courts and the Commission read "color" to have its commonly understood meaning - pigmentation, complexion, or skin shade or tone. Thus, color discrimination occurs when a person is discriminated against based on the lightness, darkness, or other color characteristic of the person. Title VII prohibits race/color discrimination against all persons, including Caucasians.
Although a plaintiff may prove a claim of discrimination through direct or circumstantial evidence, some courts take the position that if a white person relies on circumstantial evidence to establish a reverse discrimination claim, he or she must meet a heightened standard of proof. The Commission, in contrast, applies the same standard of proof to all race discrimination claims, regardless of the victim's race or the type of evidence used. In either case, the ultimate burden of persuasion remains always on the plaintiff.
Employers should adopt "best practices" to reduce the likelihood of discrimination and to address impediments to equal employment opportunity.

<h2> DIFFERENT TYPES OF RACE DISCRIMINATION</h2>

<p> There are four main types of race discrimination.

  Direct discrimination
This happens when someone treats you worse than another person in a similar situation because of your race. For example:

if a letting agency would not let a flat to you because of your race, this would be direct race discrimination.

Indirect discrimination
This happens when an organization has a particular policy or way of working that puts people of your racial group at a disadvantage.
a hairdresser refuses to employ stylists that cover their own hair, this would put any Muslim women or Sikh men who cover their hair at a disadvantage when applying for a position as a stylist Sometimes indirect race discrimination can be permitted if the organization or employer is able to show that there is a good reason for the discrimination. This is known as objective justification. For example:

A Somalian asylum seeker tries to open a bank account but the bank states that in order to be eligible you need to have been resident in the UK for 12 months and have a permanent address. The Somalian man is not able to open a bank account. The bank would need to prove that its policy was necessary for business reasons (such as to prevent fraud) and that there was no practical alternative

Harassment
Harassment occurs when someone makes you feel humiliated, offended or degraded. For example:
a young British Asian man at work keeps being called a racist name by colleagues. His colleagues say it is just banter, but the employee is insulted and offended by it

Harassment can never be justified. 
However, if an organization or employer can show it did everything it could to prevent people who work for it from behaving like that, you will not be able to make a claim for harassment against it, although you could make a claim against the harasser.
