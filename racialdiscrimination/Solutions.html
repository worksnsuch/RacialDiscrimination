    <h2> LISTEN AND EDUCATE YOURSELF </h2> 

    <p>Pay attention to the voices of people who experience racism every day – listen to friends, classmates, neighbours, and community leaders. 

    There are also a lot of articles, books, documentaries, films and podcasts on issues of racism, discrimination and privilege.  Listen to what the people in them have to say. Understand and confront your own privilege. Be prepared to feel uncomfortable at times. Many of us absorb biases and prejudices at an early age, so they are not easy to unlearn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sl2">
    <h2>RAISE AWARENESS</h2>
    
    <p>Share the resources that you have found useful with your community to help them learn how they can play a role in ending racism and discrimination. If you have younger siblings or family members, set a good example for them. Try to look for games or books that can help them learn that we all have a right to dignity and safety - there are lots online.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sl3">
    <h2>CHALLENGE EVERYDAY DISCRIMINATION AND RACISM</h2>
    <p>Racism and discrimination happen around us all the time. Often it is in the form of jokes, stereotypes or insensitive comments and questions from our friends, family members or colleagues. If you witness a friend or family member saying racist or discriminatory things, you should talk to them, if you feel safe to do so. Approach them privately first – in person or via direct message.

    They are more likely to be receptive if they don’t feel publicly embarrassed. Point out to them that what they are saying is racist or discriminatory and remind them that everyone has the right to dignity and that in many countries it is against the law to discriminate against a person because of the color of their skin, their ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation. Encourage them to learn more about the historical context of racial prejudice and discrimination, and share resources that you have found helpful.   
    
    If you see someone being bullied or harassed, intervene if it is safe to do so. </p>  
    </div>

    <div class="sl4">
    <h2>REPORT RACIST OR DISCRIMINATORY CONTENT ONLINE</h2> 
    <p>Many social media platforms want their platforms to be safe and empowering for people of all backgrounds. If you see content that you think violates their guidelines, report it to the platform. 

    If you see content in a newspaper or other traditional media that reflects prejudice, leave a comment or  send a letter to the editor to let others know that intolerant remarks are unkind and uncalled for. 
    </p>

    <div class="sl5">
    <h2>IS YOUR SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY AGAINST RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION?</h2> 
    <p>
    Schools and universities should be safe places for children and young people of all races and ethnicities. Find out whether your school or university has a policy on non-discrimination and racism, safe ways to report incidents, support services, and programmes or initiatives to promote tolerance, diversity and inclusion. If not, work with other students and school/university management to start a discussion and identify ways in which your place of learning can become a safer and more empowering environment for all students.

    <p>Legislation to promote racial equality: Governments around the world have passed laws to promote racial equality and reduce discrimination. For example, in the United States, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the Equality Act of 2010 aims to protect people from discrimination based on a number of characteristics, including race.
    These laws provide legal protection for individuals who may face discrimination based on their race. By establishing legal consequences for discriminatory behavior, these laws aim to create a more equitable society. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of these laws can be limited by factors such as social attitudes and enforcement practices.
    <br> <br>
    Reference:
    Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241 (1964).
    Equality Act 2010, c. 15 (U.K.). </p>
    
    <p> Education and awareness campaigns: Organizations and individuals can take action to raise awareness of racial issues and promote understanding and tolerance. For example, educational institutions can provide curriculum and training that addresses issues of diversity and inclusion. Similarly, advocacy groups and non-profits can run campaigns to increase public awareness of the impacts of racism and to promote empathy and understanding.
    By raising awareness of the causes and impacts of racism, these efforts aim to promote social change and reduce discrimination. However, it is important to note that education and awareness campaigns may not be effective on their own and may need to be paired with other interventions, such as policy changes or community organizing.

    <p> Affirmative action programs: Governments and organizations may implement affirmative action programs to address historical discrimination and promote diversity. These programs provide preferential treatment to members of underrepresented groups, such as racial minorities or women, in areas such as education, employment, and contracting.
    By promoting diversity, these programs aim to reduce discrimination and increase opportunities for members of underrepresented groups. However, affirmative action programs can be controversial and may face legal challenges, particularly if they are seen as unfairly benefiting some groups at the expense of others.

    <p> Community organizing: Communities can organize to address racial issues and promote social change. For example, community groups may work to address issues such as police brutality, housing discrimination, or disparities in healthcare.
    By organizing around shared goals, communities can amplify their voices and influence policy change. However, community organizing can also face challenges such as lack of resources, political opposition, or disunity within the community.

    <p> Personal accountability: Individuals can take action to address their own biases and promote racial equity. For example, individuals can educate themselves on issues of race and racism, actively challenge discriminatory behavior, and support initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion.
    By taking personal responsibility for their own actions and attitudes, individuals can contribute to a larger societal shift towards racial equity. However, it is important to recognize that individual action alone may not be sufficient to address systemic issues of racism and discrimination.
